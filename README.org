* Bookmark topper Firefox extension

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bookmark-topper/

By default Firefox creates new bookmarks at the very bottom of their
folders. The same happens when you drop a bookmark onto some folder or change
the folder for some bookmark via the star dropdown interface in the address bar:
it will become the last one in the folder.

This extension changes the behavior so newly created bookmarks would be placed
at the top of their folders along with bookmarks dropped onto a folder.

There is a shortcoming though: if you drop a bookmark not onto a folder but
exactly into the last position inside, the bookmark will still be moved to the
top. So to place some bookmark at the very bottom, first place it last but one,
next move the last one above it.

*Notice*: As of now Firefox does [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/bookmarks/onImportBegan#browser_compatibility][not]] support =bookmarks.onImport*= API, so the
addon can't disable itself for the import duration and the order of import will
be reversed. *You should disable the extension before import and enable it
after.*
